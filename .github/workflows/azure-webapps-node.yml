# This workflow will build and push a Node.js application to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-nodejs?tabs=linux&pivots=development-environment-cli
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Create a secret in your repository named AZURE_CREDENTIALS, paste the Service Principal JSON as the value of the secret.
#    For instructions on obtaining the Service Principal, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/actions/azure-login#service-principal
#
# 2. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME. Optionally, change the AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables below.
